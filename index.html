        <div class="secsubtag text-small"><p>Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
             such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the 
             development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the
              role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists 
              require that education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral
               definition of the term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process,
                but to the product of this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people.
                 Education originated as the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next.

        <div class="secsubtag text-small"><p>Types of education are commonly divided into formal, non-formal, and 
            informal education. Formal education takes place in education and training institutions, is usually 
            structured by curricular aims and objectives, and learning is typically guided by a teacher. In most 
            regions, formal education is compulsory up to a certain age and commonly divided into educational stages
             such as kindergarten, primary school and secondary school. Nonformal education occurs as addition or 
             alternative to formal education.[1] It may be structured according to educational arrangements, but 
             in a more flexible manner, and usually takes place in community-based, workplace-based or civil.

             and efficiency of education towards relevance in students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern
              or future society at large, or for evidence-based education methodologies. A right to education has been
               recognized by some governments and the United Nations.[a] Global initiatives aim at achieving the 
               Sustainable Development Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all.
